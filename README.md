# Fungi-classifcation

This project aims to accelarate Fungal indetification performed in BioEngineering department at DTU using Deep Learning.

## Setup

### Setup environment

First create a conda virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
conda create --name <my-env>
```

Then install the requirements:

```bash
# to install requirements
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

The project currently uses the pytorch nightly build for Python 3.12 compatibility.

### Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the models is a part of a research conducted at biolab at DTU, hence it's not avaiable for public use.

## Project structure

The project structure can be seen in the [structure.md](/data/structure.md) file.
